# Visualize Data with a Heat Map
A D3.js (**Version 4**) visualization app that demonstrates monthly global land-surface temperature (1753-2015).
## Getting Started

[Live Demo](http://kenzomendoza.com/FCC-HeatMap/app/)

The app is based on one of [FreeCodeCamp's challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map).

It meets the following criteria


> Story: I can view a heat map with data represented both on the Y and X axis.

> Story: Each cell is colored based its relationship to other data.

> Story: I can mouse over a cell in the heat map to get more exact information.

This app was made possible by using [FCC's API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json)
